Example of an MVC design based on Swing. Answer questions 1 & 2 in this README file.

Question 1: The Java Swing framework is a part of the Java Foundation Classes that provides a set of Graphical User Interface components for building desktop applications. Swing is built on top of the Abstract Window Toolkit and gives advanced, lightweight, and platform-independent components such as buttons, text fields, tables, and panels. Its purpose is to enable developers to create interactive and visually appealing interfaces in Java using an object-oriented and event-driven architecture. Swing supports the MVC design pattern internally, separating data, user interface, and user interactions to make applications easier to maintain and extend.
