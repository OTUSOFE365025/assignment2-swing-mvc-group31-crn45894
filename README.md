Example of an MVC design based on Swing. Answer questions 1 & 2 in this README file.

Question 1: The Java Swing framework is a part of the Java Foundation Classes that provides a set of Graphical User Interface components for building desktop applications. Swing is built on top of the Abstract Window Toolkit and gives advanced, lightweight, and platform-independent components such as buttons, text fields, tables, and panels. Its purpose is to enable developers to create interactive and visually appealing interfaces in Java using an object-oriented and event-driven architecture. Swing supports the MVC design pattern internally, separating data, user interface, and user interactions to make applications easier to maintain and extend.

Question 2: This example demonstrates the MVC pattern in Java Swing by separating data, interface, and control logic. The Model holds data  with simple getters and setters. The View builds the GUI using Swing components like text fields and buttons, while the Controller connects them by handling user actions—updating the Model and displaying messages through dialog boxes. The main class assembles these components, and a separate Scanner class adds an extra interface element. Unlike conventional MVC, this version doesn’t use automatic updates or the observer pattern; instead, the Controller manually synchronizes the Model and View. The View also exposes its components to the Controller, creating tighter coupling. Overall, it’s a simplified form of MVC that effectively illustrates how the three layers interact in a small GUI application.
